                                    currently. His skills, agility and dribbling skills are a sight to behold. There is
                                    a reason why Paris Saint-Germain spilt cash to win the much-coveted signature of the
                                    forward. In the meanwhile, making him the world's most expensive player by quite
                                    some margin. There is probably no one of the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano

                            <p><small class="player-details">Lionel Andrés Messi is an Argentine professional footballer
                                    who plays as a forward
                                    or an attacking midfielder and captains the Argentina national team. He is currently
                                    a free agent.Messi started playing football as a boy and in 1995 joined the youth
                                    team of Newell’s Old Boys (a Rosario-based top-division football club). Messi’s
                                    phenomenal skills garnered the attention of prestigious clubs on both sides of the
                                    Atlantic. At age 13 Messi and his family relocated to Barcelona, and he began
                                    playing for FC Barcelona’s under-14 team. He scored 21 goals in 14 games for the
                                    junior team, and he quickly graduated through the higher-level teams until at age 16
                                    he was given his informal debut with FC Barcelona in a friendly match.

                                    In the 2004–05 season Messi, then 17, became the youngest official player and goal
                                    scorer in the Spanish La Liga (the country’s highest division of football). Though
                                    only 5 feet 7 inches (1.7 metres) tall and weighing 148 pounds (67 kg), he was
                                    strong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. </small></p>

                                    Portugal national team.Ronaldo’s father, José Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment
                                    manager for the local club Andorinha. (The name Ronaldo was added to Cristiano’s
                                    name in honour of his father’s favourite movie actor, Ronald Reagan, who was U.S.
                                    president at the time of Cristiano’s birth.) At age 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with a
                                    heart condition that necessitated surgery, but he was sidelined only briefly and
                                    made a full recovery. He first played for Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and
                                    then transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal (known as Sporting Lisbon), where he
                                    played for that club’s various youth teams before making his debut on Sporting’s
                                    first team in 2002.

                                    A tall player at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 metres), Ronaldo was a formidable athlete on
                                    the pitch. </small></p>

                                    would drive the promising young footballer on the 140 kilometer round trip so he
                                    could train at the academy of the region's professional team, Instituto.
                                    Few countries in the world have a passion for football quite like Argentina --
                                    Dybala jokes that "when you are born, first they give you a ball, and then a dummy"
                                    -- and like almost every other child in the country, he dreamed of becoming a
                                    footballer.
                                    After Adolfo, it was Instituto that first noticed Dybala's prodigious talent and
                                    offered the lithe teenager a place in the club's youth system.
                                    Cordoba in itself can often seem a world away from Laguna Larga, so for Dybala to
